# Glimpse

Glimpse is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

## What is different about Glimpse?
For now, not a lot! The initial aim is to provide a downstream fork of
the GNU Image Manipulation Program that has a less offensive name.

Issue that got dismissed: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/issues/3617

Upstream project's explanation:
https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it

In future versions we intend to address other long-standing complaints,
particularly around the graphical user interface.

## How will the package versions work?
Glimpse will be a hard fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program based on
version 2.10.12, although we will periodically include upstream updates
in "batches" in future releases.

The actual version scheme we will use is still being discussed.

## How can I keep up to date with Glimpse's progress?
For now, follow [Bobby Moss](https://bobadon.co.uk/@bob) on the fediverse. In
the near future he will create a proper "project" account for people to follow.
You can also "star" or "watch" this Github repository to keep up-to-date with
code-level changes.

## How can I contribute?
Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/issues)
page and see where you can contribute.

Alternatively you can help by spreading the word, adding to the documentation or
providing new artwork. Once we have our first release we will also start accepting
financial donations to cover the costs of hosting and developing this fork.
